<br><br>
<p>POSITION: 19-3011.00 – ECONOMIST</p>
<br><br>
The main task is conducting applied economic analysis and reporting on overall market performance and efficiency, the impact of proposed revisions to market rules, and market participant behavior. Develops and evaluates a reliability or availability estimate for a system by statistical modeling. An employee performing a dependability analysis for DECODE DATA INC. must confront the question: is specific statistical modeling most appropriate to the system under consideration, or should another technique be used instead?
This knowledge question provokes discursive evaluation rather than any single, definitive response. Being willing to ask meaningful questions is a prerequisite to moving away from the familiar in order to “embrace the new.” Questioning stimulates creativity. One good question can generate whole new fields of inquiry and can prompt changes in entrenched corporate thinking.  
DECODE DATA INC. is challenging itself to hire a candidate reasonably au fait with quantitative economics and machine learning to bring on board in a position: 19-3011.00 – ECONOMIST.  The industry we're in (NAICS 5417 Scientific Research and Development Services/SIC 8733 Noncommercial Research Organizations) calls for the joint integration of economic theory, statistics/econometrics, data knowledge, and machine learning. 
Our standards are higher because our 509(a)(2) operation as a nonprofit research organization is distinct in that DECODE DATA INC. receives few gifts or grants and one-third of its support comes from gross investment income and unrelated business taxable income.  The leadership is seeking a part-time candidate to pull out meaningful insights from an integrated course sequence to inform strategic guidance about investments and mobile application development based on our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition.
Working with cross-functional teams of model developers, data scientists, industry analysts, and business executives require a strong theoretical and empirical background in microeconomics, econometrics, statistical analysis and software programming. A candidate must have a full grasp of microeconomic principles as it relates to the tech industry. A candidate’s analysis will be used extensively throughout the DECODE DATA INC. to drive tactical and strategic decisions at the regional, business unit, and corporate levels.
Requirements: Experience in one or more of the following areas: applied economic analysis, statistical analysis, industrial organization, market performance monitoring, utility operations and planning, and regulatory or policy analysis. Experience with data verification, large data sets, computer modeling, programming techniques and analysis of market performance is helpful. Demonstrated skills directly related to or transferable to market monitoring. Familiarity with the analysis of market operations and performance, and/or design and operation of California or other Western markets is desirable. Working knowledge of GitHub, SAS, SQL queries and SQL database formats, Python, R, as well as other analytical computer skills (e.g. Excel).
Data Science Project Management (DSPM): A data science project is a complex undertaking within the boundaries of time, budget, and company resources that produce new or enhanced computer code that adds substantial business value to DECODE DATA INC. The candidate will: (i) collaborate with cross-functional data and product teams to define problem statements, access and manipulate data, build models, explain data-gathering requirements, deliver analytics insights, and make recommendations; (ii) apply statistical techniques to evaluate A/B tests, debug regressions, and extrapolate findings from dogfooding data to the general population; and (iii) apply advanced statistical/Machine learning techniques to build intelligence into products/processes. 
<br><br>
Since this role is dealing with uncertainty and infinite possibilities, DECODE DATA INC. expects a candidate to have undergone a final review and assessment of their knowledge pertaining to topics or subjects related to 
<br><br>
1) Microeconomics, 2) Macroeconomics, 3) Mathematical Methods, 4) Probability and Statistics, 5) Econometrics, 6) Machine Learning, and 7) Computer Programing. 
<br><br>

19-3011.00 – ECONOMIST occupation is inextricably linked and must be integrated for: (i) adapting theory to a practical application in a competitive environment; (ii) selecting the most appropriate solutions with respect to specific contexts; or (iii) changing the strategic focus of statistical data analysis when adaptation and selection of existing technologies and methodologies are not an option.
<br><br>
To be eligible for consideration, the candidate must have a Ph.D. degree with a specialization in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics.
