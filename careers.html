<h1 class="bu jh ji bw jj">POSITION: 19-3011.00 – ECONOMIST</h1>
  <div class="ir jk"><p>Our policy applied scientists work with our policy issue experts around the world, equipping them with data and insights to inform our public policy positions. The Economics team produces in-house research and collaborates with world-leading academics to understand our marketplace and improve our products.</p>
    <h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
    <p>The main task is conducting applied economic analysis and reporting on overall market performance and efficiency, the impact of proposed revisions to market rules, and market participant behavior. Develops and evaluates a reliability or availability estimate for a system by statistical modeling. An employee performing a dependability analysis for DECODE DATA INC. must confront the question: is specific statistical modeling most appropriate to the system under consideration, or should another technique be used instead?</p>
    <p>This knowledge question provokes discursive evaluation rather than any single, definitive response. Being willing to ask meaningful questions is a prerequisite to moving away from the familiar in order to “embrace the new.” Questioning stimulates creativity. One good question can generate whole new fields of inquiry and can prompt changes in entrenched corporate thinking.</p>
    <p>DECODE DATA INC. is challenging itself to hire a candidate reasonably au fait with quantitative economics and machine learning to bring on board in a position: 19-3011.00 – ECONOMIST.

    <p>Our standards are higher because our 509(a)(2) operation as a nonprofit research organization is distinct in that DECODE DATA INC. receives few gifts or grants and one-third of its support comes from gross investment income and unrelated business taxable income.  The leadership is seeking a part-time candidate to pull out meaningful insights from an integrated course sequence to inform strategic guidance about investments and mobile application development based on our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition.</p>
    <p>Working with cross-functional teams of model developers, data scientists, industry analysts, and business executives require a strong theoretical and empirical background in microeconomics, econometrics, statistical analysis and software programming. A candidate must have a full grasp of microeconomic principles as it relates to the tech industry. A candidate’s analysis will be used extensively throughout the DECODE DATA INC. to drive tactical and strategic decisions at the regional, business unit, and corporate levels.</p>
